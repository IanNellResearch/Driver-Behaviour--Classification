# Driver-Behaviour--Classification
The Objective is to classify a driver's behaviour using external observation techniques for autonomous vehicles, as most vehicles on the road are not connected and cannot relay the dangers of drivers on the road. 

Road traffic accidents remain a primary global concern, with human error, particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes [1]. In response to this issue, the present study investigates a novel, externally focused driver behaviour classification system designed to detect indicators of distraction and impairment through non-intrusive observation techniques. This research uses advanced computer vision methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. The proposed framework utilises a vision-based approach, enabling behavioural analysis of non-connected vehicles, thus eliminating the dependency on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication systems. Implementing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model alongside custom lane estimation algorithms, the system identifies aberrant driving behaviours—such as excessive lateral movement or erratic trajectory patterns—indicative of distraction or impairment. Experimental evaluations conducted on diverse video datasets from real-world driving scenarios highlight the framework’s capability to detect unsafe behaviour reliably. The proposed method demonstrates adaptability and robustness despite inherent challenges, such as faded or absent lane markings, complex road geometries, environmental variability, and occlusions. Moreover, it provides valuable insights for monitoring driver behaviour in transitional periods where manually operated vehicles coexist with increasingly autonomous systems.
Future work will enhance detection accuracy by refining lane detection algorithms, expanding training datasets to better reflect diverse road and lighting conditions, and integrating data from complementary sensor modalities such as LiDAR, GPS, and IMUs. These advancements are expected to significantly improve the system’s performance, scalability, and applicability in promoting road safety.
